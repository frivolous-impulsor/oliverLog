        Special thanks to Ye for his fabulous masterpieces(Ye, Graduation, Late Registration, The Life of Pablo, Heartbreak&808 and many more) that support me writing this website as well as living. Much love.
    </p>

    <p class="h6">
        The website is a django project that supports user login/out/register. Upon logged in, a user is entitled to
        create/edit/delete abtrary number of seed profiles of theirs.
        A seed profile is a basic introduction of a seed, including it's name, time to obtain(month of the year), growth
        rate, picture, picture after grow up, general difficulty to plant, and maybe more. Each seed possesses numerous
        steps to plant, including how to extract seed, process seed, plant seed, after plant measurements, watering
        frequency and all based on user's understanding and preference.(working on currently - 2024.01.27)
        A visitor, regardless of log status, is able to check the list of seed types based on their attributes like
        obtain month, growth rate, difficulty to plant, and maybe more.(working on currently - 2024.01.27)

    <p class="h6 my-3">Backend:
        As the project grows, it's additional functionality weighs visibly heavier than it's initial prototype "post",
        which is th
        e skelliton I've followed from Corey Shafer's Django beginer course
        at Youtube. And accordingly, it leans ever more towards my initial
        incentive of learning django, which is to build a website that
        utilize backend database to analytically deliver informtaion about planting techniques, for fruit seeds like
        lemon, apple, and tree seeds like acorn and whatever that I haven't heard of. Surprisingly, with the robust
        class views and models of django, I can easily build an interactive website that receives user input and store
        them in database.</p>
    <p class="h6">Front end
        The website is styled using bootstrap5. Thanks to its convenience,
        a couple keywords can make this website at least not aesthetically
        repelling.
        I'm considering between Vue or React for javascript framework.
        Honestly, I don't even know javascript yet, and the website at
        current state doesn't appear to need any javascript. So it's currently not equiped with any front-end framework
        except bootstrap5.</p>
